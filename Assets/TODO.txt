TODO:

- Each Tower gameobject needs to feed their arrow prefab a lifetime float.
  This should be based on the radius that the tower can see as well as its fire rate.
  

- Add The day counter to the ui

- Resource gathering is too quick
- Perhaps scale the building cost on every x waves?

- Add an indicator to towers so when a player is looking for a place to put them, it shows its attack range

- When game ends, the resource gatherers should stop gathering, enemies should do some celebrating?
  Basically there should be a gameover event that is fired when the gameover screen loads.
  This should disable every component that isn't related to rendering.

- Place enemy trail on top layer

- Refactor repairButton logic so that each building type not only takes gold but may take other resources

- Next raid should decrease every x raids

- It would be cool to have the waves manager actually select a spawn transform that gets closer as the waves count increases.

- Add the ability to switch between the different "Build" buttons by using the number keys.
  IE Press 1 and the arrow is selected.  press 2 and the wood harvester is selected.

- Add the ability to hold down the middle mouse button and drag to move the camera.
  So if the button is down and they drag up, the camera moves as though W is pressed.

- Add The ability to toggle the options menu by pressing the escape key

- Implement an object pool system for enemies and arrows.  Instantiate more in blocks as needed.

- Create some sort of system where resoure nodes can be depleted and die.  In order for this to work,
  new resources should grow too.
  
- Create different types of enemies or have enemies increase in health every x raids

- Create upgrade feature so that buildings can have their health increase and possibly
  shoot faster or with stronger projectiles
  
  
  


IDEA:
- Use this same system for some sort of space game where different planets have different resources.
  This will require many different harvester types as well as resource types.
  So the spaceship requires fuel to get to other planets.  Resouce gatherers require specific resources.
  Each planet may have their own "Enemies" Indiginous people and there should be another faction that is
  your main enemy.  They will blow up your resource gatherers 
  
  This will require a Main Menu scene, A ResourceManager Scene, a scene for each planet and a "galaxy" scene.
